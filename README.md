The big event. The final show of the tour. But poor Sebastian's vocal chords just don't seem to be working tonight. It's up to you to shout, sing and everything in between to make his tongue move up and down. A challenging 2.5D platformer game, Tongue Twister will test your ability to reach all the volumes to collect all the stars. Bravo!

## How to Play
The easiest way to play is to download the executable from our page on the [official Global Game Jam site](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/tongue-twister). 
Please note there is an issue with the game over scene on some computers. If you experience this issue, clone this repo and open
the game in the Unity Editor, running the Menu Scene. The game was built for Unity version 5.5.0.

## Development
Tongue Twister was created in Global Game Jam 2017 (January 20 - 22) by 4 students at the University of Lincoln. The theme was 'waves' and the game won the best technical prize at the Lincoln jam site.
